*View code through rose-tinted glasses.*

Lets you have custom syntactic sugar (or any arbitrary changes!) which appear only in your editor, but are replaced with functioning code when saved to disk and vice versa.

## Features

- Disagree with your team-mates about style issues? See and edit code in your preferred style while saving files to disk using your team's coding style.
- Dislike a certain keyword? Change it! Replace `self` with `this`, or `elif` with `else if` or even with `否则如果`. When saving it will appear as before on the disk (and in version control, etc.).
- Is there a certain syntax missing from your otherwise favourite programming language? Add optional arguments to lua, list comprehensions to javascript, array literals to Game Maker Studio 1.4, or anything else you can dream of.
